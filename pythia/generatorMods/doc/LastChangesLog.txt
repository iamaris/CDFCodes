Pythia updated to 6.203 in development and tagged in software
release 4.4.0int3. Problems with this version and the dummy 
version of upinit and upevnt in pythia_services, which cannot
be seen, exist. Acedemic for now but will causes problems if
an external generator is to be interfaced.

Accessors and talk-tos provided to PYINT2 as requested by the
Higgs group.
