How to save/restore random state for generator.

1) You can set up random seed for particular generator through
   talk-to.

2) At the end of the job or abort job random state is dumped:
   - underlying fortran dumps random states of predefined random
     streams into file defined by RNSTAT variable. Predefined 
     streams are 
   
       RN_QFL1
       RN_QFL2
       RN_QFL3
       RN_ISAJ
       RN_CLEO
       RN_HERW
       RN_PYTH
       RN_WGRD
       RN_USED

     this is based on TRn's fortran interface.  

   - CLHEP based random engines if registed in CdfRn::Instance()
     are dumped into CdfRnStat.dat file

  All TRn streams different from predefined will be moved to CdfRn.   

  Don't forget to define RNSTAT.   

3) To restore random state from $RNSTAT and CdfRnStat.dat
   for generators 

   talk GenInputManager
     RestoreRandomStream set true
   exit

   Don't forget to define RNSTAT.

   
4) Old code residuals will be removed.
